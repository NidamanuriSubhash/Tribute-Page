<h2>A brief Biography of Subhas Chandra Bose</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among Indians, but his wartime
 alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.
 The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of
 the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India
</p>
<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>
Subhas Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897, in Cuttack, Bengal Presidency, British India, to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi.<br>

* A brilliant student since childhood, Bose exceled in his studies, attaining an overall second position in the matriculation examination. He enrolled at 
  the ‘Presidency College’ in 1911, but was expelled for assaulting Professor Oaten for making anti-India comments.<br>

* He then completed his graduation from ‘Scottish Church College’ at the ‘University of Calcutta,’ attaining a BA in philosophy in 1918. 
  The following year, he gained admission into ‘Fitzwilliam College,’ Cambridge to appear for the ‘Indian Civil Services Examination’ (ICS).<br>

*  As per his father’s wish, Bose cracked the examination and secured a job with the civil service department. However, he did not continue with his 
   job for long as he never liked working under the British government.Bose gave up his hard-earned, lucrative job and came back to India, where he joined the ‘Indian National Congress’ 
   to fight for the independence of the nation. For the same, he started a newspaper called ‘Swaraj.’ Additionally, he even took charge of publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.
</p>

<h3>Graduation</h3>
<p>
Subhas Chandra Bose was the ninth out of the fourteen children of Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Dutt. He attended the Protestant European School, 
which is now called Stewart High School, along with his other siblings in Cuttack. He was a brilliant student and had a knack for knowing which earned 
him a second position in the matriculation exam. He attended the Presidency College (now University) in Calcutta and was greatly influenced by the teachings 
and philosophies of Swami Vivekananda and Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa Dev by reading their works when he was 16 years old.
</p>
<h3>Political Pursuits</h3>
<p>
* After being released from the prison in 1927, Bose began his full-fledged political career. He secured the position of the general secretary of the ‘Congress Party’ and 
  started working alongside Jawaharlal Nehru.

*Three years later, Bose became the mayor of Calcutta. In the mid-1930s, he traveled to Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini.

 Over the years, Bose gained so much popularity that he became a national leader. Also, his popularity and admiration won him a nomination to serve as a Congress president.

* Bose’s nomination did not go well with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi opposed Bose’s run for presidency as the latter believed in attaining complete freedom, even if it 
  meant using force against the British. Gandhi, on the other hand, believed in attaining independence through non-violence.

* Clash of opinions caused a split in the ‘Indian National Congress,’ with Bose forming his own cabinet. 
  In the 1939 Congress presidential elections, Bose defeated Pattabhi Sitaramayya (Gandhi’s chosen candidate), but could not continue his presidency 
  for long as his belief system was totally different from that of the members of the ‘Congress Working Committee.’
</p>
<h3>Awards & Achievements</h3>
<p>
* Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was posthumously honored with a ‘Bharat Ratna’ award, India’s highest civilian award. However, the award was
  later withdrawn following a PIL, which was filed in a court, against the ‘posthumous’ nature of the award; the award committee could not 
  produce substantial evidence proving Netaji’s demise.<br>

* A statue of Netaji has been erected in front of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, while his photo can be seen on one of the walls of the Indian Parliament.<br>

* In recent times, he has been depicted in popular culture. There are various films that depict the story of this Indian nationalist hero.
</p>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>
* "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!" is one of the many famous quotes of this Indian nationalist leader during the 
  struggle for independence. Other famous quotes include “Dilli Chalo,” “Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani,” “Jai Hind,” and “Glory to India!” <br>

* He was the founder of the ‘All India Forward Bloc Party.’


</p>
<h3>Role in Freedom Struggle</h3>
<p>
He was sent to jail in 1930 during the Civil Disobedience movement but was related along with other prominent leaders in the year 1931 when the Gandhi-Irwin 
pact was signed. In 1938, he was elected as President at the Haripura session of the INC and re-elected at the Tripuri Session in 1939 by competing against 
Dr P. Sitaramayya who was supported by Gandhi himself. He maintained strict standards during the commencement of the first World War and demanded full independence 
of India from the British within six months. He faced vehement objections from inside the Congress which led him to resign from INC and form a more progressive 
group called the “Forward Bloc”. He started a mass movement against using Indian men in the wars of foreign countries which received immense support and voice which 
led him to be put under house arrest in Calcutta but he left the house in disguise in January 1941 and reached Germany via Afghanistan and met the Nazi leader there to 
seek help from them to drive the British away from India. He also sought help from Japan. He made full use of the philosophy “an enemy's enemy is a friend”.
